## 🎬 **THE ORIGIN STORY**: From Dad Drama to Digital Solution

> *"Why did I build this? Well, picture this: I'm a dad of two amazing boys, trying to navigate the 'wonderful' world of post-divorce communication. My ex had a PhD in Creative Complaint Writing and a master's degree in Selective Memory Syndrome. 🎭*
>
> *Every week brought new accusations about things I supposedly said, didn't say, should have said, or said in the wrong tone. It was like playing telephone with someone who had clearly failed the game as a child. 📞*
>
> *After losing count of "But you NEVER told me that!" vs "I have the screenshot right here" conversations, I realized I needed a system. Not just for the legal stuff (though that became handy), but for my own sanity. Because apparently, keeping track of communication is harder than keeping two boys from destroying the house on a sugar high. 🏠💥*
>
> *So I built CommuniTrack - because life's too short to play he-said-she-said with someone who changes the rules mid-game. Now I document everything with the efficiency of a Swiss accountant and the paranoia of a conspiracy theorist. 🕵️‍♂️*
>
> *The best part? It actually works! No more "that never happened" gaslighting, no more frantic searching through months of texts, and definitely no more stress-induced coffee addiction. Well, maybe still the coffee addiction - I am a developer, after all. ☕"*

**TL;DR**: Built by a dad who got tired of communication chaos and decided to code his way to clarity. If you're in a similar boat, this one's for you! 🚢
